rtsave - Writes current Solaris routing table to shell script for boot.

It's easy to make changes to the static routes on a systems and forget to
make the corresponding changes in the boot script, or you may make an error
when updating the file. This script ensures that that the active routing table
and the boot script are in sync. It also allows for backup versions to be made.

Usage: rtsave [-f <filename> ] [-r <symlink> ] [-BFds]
Options:
      -f <filename>   - shell script that is created
      -r <link>       - symlink used if -B is specified
      -d              - do NOT save default (e.g. if defaultrouter file
                      is used instead
      -B              - creates new time-stamped file and updates symlink
                      in rc2.d directory (or wherever specified)
      -F              - force old file to be overwritten
      -s              - create symlink (implied by -B)
